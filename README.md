4,Lightning Bolt,M21,foil
1,Black Lotus,LEA,
2,Counterspell,7ED,showcase
```

### 2. Upload and Configure

1. **Upload your CSV file** by dragging it into the upload area or clicking to browse

   - **Force Condition**: Check this to apply a specific condition to all cards
     - Choose from: Near Mint, Slightly Played, Moderately Played, Heavily Played, or Damaged
